#Who am I?      


 *Enter cheesy descriptive quote* : "Everything lies in the basics, all the fansy things you see on top is nothing but a manifestation of the basics. Knowing how things work and why is what one continuously thrive to achieve" 


"Hello World"! I"m Vaibhav - I graduated from the University of New South Wales with 1st Honours in Mechanical Engineering - where I learnt most of what everyone calls problem solving skills. I've been a left-brained person since I could remember, pulling things apart and putting them back together; let it be software or mechanics.   
        
 Moving ahead Why Mechanical Engineering and now software? Well, turns out being a Mechanical engineer made it easy to get my residency in Australia and I genuinely loved Physics and Maths, it excited me, I loved landing that solution - a rush! I attribute most of my calculative mentality to my engineering and I this helped moving into software relatively better. 
 
 The present : After finishing General Assembly and feeling like I really wanted to learn more, and do it in a short time frame, I joined Hack Reactor, the equivalent of a 3 month programming hackathon = 1400 hours of programming, 9AM-11PM 6 days a week. Here I learnt and approached JavaScript and production grade application development using <strong>Computer Science</strong> Mindset. Needless to say I loved every moment of it, no stone unturned, I feel confident in my skills, and i feel certainly confident in JavaScript.
